# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual representation of a digital product’s layout, structure, and functionality. It acts as a blueprint, showing how different elements (such as navigation menus, buttons, and content sections) will be arranged on a page or screen. Unlike fully designed mockups, wireframes focus more on structure and usability rather than colors, fonts, or detailed visuals.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process because it:

- **Clarifies ideas**: Helps designers, developers, and stakeholders align on the project’s structure before diving into detailed design.
- **Saves time and costs**: Identifies potential usability issues early, reducing the need for costly revisions later in development.
- **Improves collaboration**: Serves as a communication tool that bridges the gap between creative concepts and technical implementation.
- **Enhances usability**: Ensures that the user experience is prioritized by focusing on functionality and navigation flow.

By using wireframes, teams can make informed decisions early on, leading to more efficient workflows and better end products.
